## Buckling Analysis of Simply Supported Aluminum Plates

### Objective
- Analyze the buckling behavior of a simply supported aluminum plate under uniformly distributed compressive load.
- Compare analytical results with finite element analysis (FEA) using ABAQUS software.

### Methodology
- **Analytical Calculations:** 
  - Used classical plate theory to derive critical buckling loads.
  - Calculated critical loads for different buckling modes.
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA):**
  - Developed a model in ABAQUS using the eigenvalue method.
  - Conducted simulations to determine buckling mode shapes and critical loads.
  - Performed a mesh convergence study to ensure accuracy.

### Key Findings
- **Critical Load Calculation:**
  - Analytical method provided critical load values for five modes.
  - Mode 1: 25,306.68 N
  - Mode 2: 29,700.2 N
  - Mode 3: 39,541.68 N
  - Mode 4: 39,541.68 N
  - Mode 5: 53,207.29 N
- **FEA Results:**
  - Closely matched analytical results with less than 1.6% error.
  - Demonstrated the reliability of ABAQUS for buckling analysis.
- **Mesh Convergence:**
  - As element size decreased, FEA results converged towards analytical solutions.
  - Achieved convergence with 861 nodes.

### Conclusion
- ABAQUS effectively simulates the buckling behavior of thin plates.
- Analytical and FEA results were in close agreement, validating the use of FEA for such studies.
- Ensuring mesh convergence is crucial for accurate FEA results.
- Recommendations to prevent buckling include using stringers or increasing plate thickness.

### Implications
- Reliable FEA can significantly reduce material costs and enhance design efficiency in aerospace and naval applications.

### Key Points
- Analytical and FEA approaches for buckling analysis.
- Critical load values for different buckling modes.
- Validation of ABAQUS software through close agreement with analytical results.
- Importance of mesh convergence in FEA.
- Practical methods to prevent buckling in thin plates.
