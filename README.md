## Projects

**CFD - Analysis of internal, external, and multiphase flow with heat transfer**

- Generated CAD models with SolidWorks and ANSYS Design Modeler based on provided specifications. Employed both laminar and turbulent flow models to analyze and compare key parameters, Vorticity, and Stream function.

**DoE - Test to measure the acidity among different types of coffee and its brewing methods**

- Conducted a full factorial experiment 2^3 to assess acidity variations in freshly brewed coffee, employing a pH meter and managing data through Microsoft Excel while performing in-depth analysis (ANOVA) using JMP Pro statistical software.
- Investigated two-way and three-way interactions to evaluate significance of critical variables, enhancing understanding of their impact.

**Liquid-Desiccant Dehumidification for Air Conditioning**

- Conducted a comprehensive study on liquid-desiccant dehumidification to optimize humidity control and air temperature reduction. Optimized system performance through response surface methodology, focusing on variables such as inlet air temperature and relative humidity.
- Developed theoretical models and performed experimental analysis, achieving significant reductions in air temperature (from 35°C to 25°C) and humidity (from 0.021 kg/kg to 0.0055 kg/kg). Proposed hybrid systems for improved stability and performance in varied climates.
- Developed regression models to predict system efficiency, achieving a COP range of 1.44 to 2.4, demonstrating potential for energy savings and improved environmental impact.
